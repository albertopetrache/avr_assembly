# AVR Assembly Examples

This repository contains a collection of **AVR Assembly programs** for various ATmega microcontrollers, primarily targeting the **ATmega1284P**.  

## Overview

The repository aims to provide:

- Example programs for **USART communication**, timers, LED control, and numeric conversions.
- Demonstrations of **low-level AVR instructions** and addressing modes.
- Code suitable for learning and experimentation with **AVR Assembly**.

## Requirements

- **Microcontroller**: ATmega1284P (or compatible AVR MCU)
- **Clock**: External crystal recommended (e.g., 14.7456 MHz)
- **Development tools**: Microchip Studio
- **Serial terminal**: For observing USART outputs (PuTTY, Tera Term, etc.)

## Usage

1. Open the `.asm` file of the program you want to try.
2. Assemble and flash it to the microcontroller.
3. Observe outputs via connected peripherals (LEDs, USART terminal, etc.).
